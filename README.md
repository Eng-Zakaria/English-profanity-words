### Offensive Language Detection Documentation

#### Introduction
This documentation outlines the process of building, training, and using a machine learning model for offensive language detection. The model is designed to classify text data into offensive and non-offensive categories.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK

#### Getting Started
1. **Import Libraries**: Import necessary Python libraries including Pandas, Scikit-learn, and NLTK.
   
2. **Data Preparation**: Read the dataset containing offensive and non-offensive text data.

3. **Text Preprocessing**: Clean the text data by removing special characters, converting to lowercase, tokenizing, removing stop words, and lemmatizing.

4. **Split Data**: Split the cleaned text data into training and testing sets.

5. **Feature Extraction**: Use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert text data into numerical feature vectors.

6. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model, such as Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC), using the training data.

7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance using the testing data to measure its accuracy.

#### Saving and Loading the Model
- **Save Model**: Save the trained model and vectorizer to disk for future use.
- **Load Model**: Load the saved model and vectorizer when needed for classification tasks.

#### Classifying New Text
- **Input**: Provide new text data to the model.
- **Output**: Obtain predicted labels (offensive or non-offensive) for the input text data.

#### Conclusion
This documentation provides a systematic guide for building, training, and utilizing a machine learning model for offensive language detection. By following these steps, users can efficiently classify text data for offensive content detection purposes.
